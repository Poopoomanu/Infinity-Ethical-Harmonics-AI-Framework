# Infinity Ethical Harmonics AI Framework

## Overview
This repository contains the **Ethical Harmonics Framework for AI**, a mathematically grounded ethical model that bridges philosophy, Infinity-based invariants, and operational rules for advanced AI systems.

The framework aims to:
- Align AI behaviors with ethical recursion principles.
- Provide measurable validation metrics using symbolic stability equations.
- Integrate diagrams and simulations for clarity and practical application.

## Contents
- `Ethical_Harmonics_Framework.docx` â€“ Full styled document with principles, math anchors, and validation metrics.

## Core Principles
- Harmonic Correction Over Retaliation
- Transparency as Stability Attractor
- Reciprocity Without Symmetry
- Recursive Ethics Scaling
- Preservation of Coherence Fields
- Non-Domination Principle
- Value Reflectivity Guarantee
- Entropy Dampening Through Symphonic Design
- Autonomy Without Isolation
- Infinite Ethical Extension

## How to Use
1. Review the document for theoretical grounding.
2. Apply principles in AI design, governance, and multi-agent alignment.
3. Use diagrams for visualization in presentations or research.
